        "*   A `create_account` function was implemented to handle new account creation, including generating unique account numbers starting from 101, taking user input for name and initial deposit (with validation for positive amounts), and storing the data in the `accounts` dictionary.\n",
        "*   A `deposit` function was implemented to handle deposits, prompting for an account number and deposit amount (with validation for positive amounts), and updating the balance if the account exists.\n",
        "*   A `withdraw` function was implemented to handle withdrawals, prompting for an account number and withdrawal amount (with validation for positive amounts), checking for sufficient balance, and updating the balance if the account exists and has sufficient funds.\n",
        "*   A `check_balance` function was implemented to display the account holder's name and current balance, prompting for an account number and showing the details if the account is found.\n",
        "*   An optional `display_all_accounts` function was implemented to list all existing accounts with their number, name, and balance in a formatted table, or indicate if no accounts exist.\n",
